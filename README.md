# beatport_scraper

This is a web scraping project that scrapes data in 'Top 100 tracks' of the beatport website using Selenium.
It can run using either Chrome or Firefox browsers and it has options for saving data locally or on the cloud (S3 and RDS).
For storing data on the cloud, the user is required to input their credentials for their S3 bucket and rename the creds_example.yaml file into creds.yaml and update it with their credentials.
